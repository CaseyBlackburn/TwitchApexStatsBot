Twitch Apex Stats is a collection of tools to add additional functionality to your Twitch streams for when you are playing Apex Legends. You can add additional commands to your current Twitch bot to let your viewers see your stats and other details related to Apex Legends. After added to Nightbot, Stream Elements, StreamLabs, or other supported bots your viewers can use commands such as:

Current Stats
See your current level, your Battle Royale rank details (Rank, RP amount, Rank Position in Predator/Master), your Arenas rank details (Rank, AP amount, Rank Position in Predator/Master), selected legend, and currently equipped legend trackers (BR Kills, BR Damage, etc).

Session Stats
After starting a session viewers can see how much RP or AP you've gained or lost in this session.

Map Rotation
The current maps in rotation for Battle Royale, Battle Royale Ranked, Arenas and Arenas Ranked. Their remaining time in the rotation and the upcoming maps can be shown as well.

Predator Cap
See how much RP or AP is needed to reach the barrier to Predator. (PC, Xbox, and Playstation supported.)

Game Server Status
Quickly check and see if there is any issues effecting the Apex Legends servers preventing players from playing. (Status provided by Apex Legends Status)
